Here you can find .stl files of the casing that are ready to print on your home 3D printer. 
The whole casing is envisaged to be printed on smaller home 3D printer, basically it is compartmentalised in 4 elements that make the whole 13.3" dimension of the case.
Those files are ready to be used on higher resolution Prusa type 3D printer.

Additionally one needs 22 pcs. M3 screws to fasten Balthazar modules inside, also to fasten covers for the keyboard and cover for LCD.
 
Assembly procedure and its description is as follows:


a) Print each .stl file once, 20 pieces of Universal Connector pegs, that are needed to connect the elements of the lower casing. 
b) Put 4 Case Bottom elements together by inserting the pegs (Universal Connector) into the corresponding holes and fasten those together, snapping those into one sturdy unit.
c) Position PCB modules, keyboard and battery packs into the place and screw those in with 3M screws. 
d) Place the 4 Case Top elements on the top of the assembled base and fasten those with 3M screws.
f) Screw the Hinge Holder on with 3 M3 screws on the each side.
e) Assemble 4 LCD Holders Bottom side 
f) Insert the 13.3" screen
g) Screw on 4 elemnets of LCD holder Top side.
h) Snap LCD Logo into outer LCd Holder middle the place.
i) Align hinges and push through Hinge Long rotate rod through until it is locked in place.

That completes basic casing assembly.
As this is ongoing design and development certain things and procedures might change and those will be updated, as progress is made.
We are also preparing a file that will ease assembly even more.
