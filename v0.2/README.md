# Bathazar case current 0.2 version 3D preview. 

This is 0.2 version of our new design, primarily meant as a technical set-up with proper measuraments for fitting internal modules.
Also it is compartmentalised to ease printing on a home 3D printer, reinforced with connecting pegs, adding extra sturdiness to the assembled case. 
Printing files are to be found in STL_Print_Case folder, together with assembly instructions. 
Casing parts are stiched together with plastic pins for extra sturdiness. 
Also you need a good stash of M3 screws to fasten the connecting and overlaying parts, and PCB modules and a keyboard. 
Those are designed with marked dedicated holes.

Also supplied is printable version of assembly procedure.

Below are general overview of the parts, modules and hands-on examples during the assembly.
