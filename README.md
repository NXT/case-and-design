# case-and-design
Balthazar's casing or a housing and the design.
This is the place for CAD and 3D ready-to-print files and design proposals.
We encourage you to adopt casing openings to a certain SoM (systems on a Module) and outputs.
Those files will be updated as we move on and as revisions change to a final look and also materials might vary.
